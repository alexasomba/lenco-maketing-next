## API Keys

All API requests require authentication using an API key. You can generate API keys from your Lenco Dashboard.

### Types of API Keys

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Test Keys** | Use these for development. Transactions are simulated. |
| **Live Keys** | Use these in production. Transactions are real. |

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.lenco.co/v1/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_xxxxx"
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose your API keys** in client-side code
2. **Rotate keys regularly** for enhanced security
3. **Use environment variables** to store keys
4. **Restrict key permissions** to only what's needed

## Webhooks Authentication

Webhook payloads include a signature header that you should verify:

```typescript
import crypto from 'crypto';

function verifyWebhookSignature(
  payload: string,
  signature: string,
  secret: string
): boolean {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return signature === expectedSignature;
}
```
