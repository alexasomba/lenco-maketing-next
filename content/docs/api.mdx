## Overview

The Lenco API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.lenco.co/v1
```

## Authentication

The Lenco API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Lenco Dashboard.

```bash
curl https://api.lenco.co/v1/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request |
| 401 | Unauthorized |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |
