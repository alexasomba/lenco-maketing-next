          Initiate a collection from a card. This endpoint requires PCI DSS
          certification

          and an encrypted payload.


          ## Encryption Process

          1. Get RSA public key from `GET /encryption-key`

          2. Generate AES session key

          3. Encrypt payload using AES-256-GCM

          4. Encrypt AES key using RSA-OAEP-256

          5. Send JWE compact serialized payload


          ## JOSE Headers

          - `enc`: A256GCM

          - `alg`: RSA-OAEP-256

          - `cty`: application/json

          - `kid`: from RSA public key


          ## 3DS Authentication

          For cards requiring 3DS, the response will have `status:
          3ds-auth-required`

          with `meta.authorization.redirect` URL. Redirect the customer to
          complete

          authentication, then they'll be redirected to your `redirectUrl`.


          See the `CardPayloadDecrypted` schema for the payload structure to
          encrypt.
