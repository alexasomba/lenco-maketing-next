# Getting Started

This page will help you get started with Lenco API.

To get your API token (also referred to as API key or secret key), kindly reach out to [support@lenco.co](mailto:support@lenco.co).

## Securing Your API Token

Someone who steals your Lenco API token can interact with your accounts on your behalf, so treat it as securely as you would treat any password. 

<Callout type="warn" title="Security Warning">
  Tokens should never be stored in source control. If you accidentally publicize a token via version control or other methods, you should immediately reach out to [support@lenco.co](mailto:support@lenco.co) to generate a new API token.
</Callout>

## Using the Token

Authenticate your API calls by including your API token in the `Authorization` header of every request you make. Authorization headers should be in the following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer xo+CAiijrIy9XvZCYyhjrv0fpSAL6CfU8CgA+up1NXqK" \
  https://api.lenco.co/access/v2/accounts
```

<Callout type="error" title="Authentication Required">
  API requests made without authentication will fail with the status code `401: Unauthorized`. All API requests must be made over HTTPS.
</Callout>

## Requests and Response

Both request body data and response data are formatted as JSON. Content type for responses will always be `application/json`.

Generally, all responses will be in the following format:

```json title="Response Format"
{
  "status": true,      // Only true if the request was processed successfully
  "message": "string", // Explains the result - log this but don't use for checks
  "data": {}           // Contains actionable result of processing if present
}
```

### Response Keys

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `status` | Boolean indicating if the request was successful |
| `message` | A string summary of the response. In case of an error, contains error description |
| `data` | The result of your request - can be an object or array depending on the endpoint |
| `meta` | Pagination context when retrieving lists (see below) |

### Pagination

When retrieving lists of resources, the `meta` key provides pagination information:

```json title="Meta Key Structure"
{
  "meta": {
    "total": 2,
    "perPage": 50,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "pageCount": 1
  }
}
```

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `total` | number | Total number of records |
| `perPage` | number | Maximum records returned per request |
| `currentPage` | number | Current page being returned (default: 1) |
| `pageCount` | number | Total pages available based on `perPage` |

## Errors

Lenco's API is RESTful and uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200`, `201` | Request was successful. For transfers/collections, check the `data` object for the actual result |
| `400` | Validation or client-side error occurred |
| `401` | Unauthorized - invalid or missing API token |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `500`, `501`, `502`, `503`, `504` | Server error on Lenco's end - please report these |

### Error Codes

If the HTTP response code is not `200` (or `201`), the response may include an `errorCode`:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01` | Validation error - one or more parameters could not be validated |
| `02` | Insufficient funds in account |
| `03` | Transfer limit on the account has been exceeded |
| `04` | Invalid or duplicate reference |
| `05` | Invalid recipient account |
| `06` | Restriction on debit account |
| `07` | Invalid or duplicate bulk transfer reference |
| `08` | Invalid number of objects in bulk transfer `transfers` parameter |
| `09` | Invalid auth token or authorization denied |
| `10` | General error |
| `11` | Resource not found |
| `12` | Invalid mobile number |
| `13` | Access to resource denied |
